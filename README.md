# Schnuppertagbericht Elina

We got to know Github and created a new file and uploaded it locally. i also made my first commit.

I have configured a website on the Rasperrypi02. I have given the website the name Tschoupi. Then I tested whether it works successfully.

We went to the Dc and now I know why it's worth it: 
1. all servers are redundant with power and internet.
2. there is always someone in charge.
3. the servers don't have to be housed somewhere in the office.  

There are many abbreviations with abbreviated meanings:

- The mkdir command in Linux is a commandline utility that allows users to create new directories. mkdir stands for "make directory." 
```bash
$ Mkdir Test_Verzeichnis
```

- The 'cd' command in Linux is used to change directories. You can navigate to a specific directory by specifying its path, such as cd Test_Documents .
```bash
$ cd Zielverzeichnis
```
-  touch: The touch command in Linux is used to create a new empty file.
```bash
$ touch file.txt
```
- ls: is designed to list the names and features of files and directories.
```bash
$ ls
```
- cat: is used to display the content in a file.
```bash
$ cat file 
```
- nano: is needed to open a document, edit it and then save it again. 
```bash
$ nano Test.txt
```
rm: you need it to remove something, you just have to enter the file name.
```bash
$ rm Test.txt
```
###Challange:

I had to search for the letter in the documents using `cd` and `ls`. Then I had to use `ls -a` to find a hidden file, which then gave me the next letter. For the fourth character I had to use the command `ls -l` to find out how big the file is in bytes, after I found out how many bytes it was I had to find out the letter in the `ASCII table`. Then I had to use `less` to see the text of a file.
