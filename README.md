# Schnuppertagbericht Elina

We got to know Github and created a new file and uploaded it locally. i also made my first commit.

I have configured a website on the Rasperrypi02. I have given the website the name Tschoupi. Then I tested whether it works successfully.

We went to the Dc and now I know why it's worth it: 
1. all servers are redundant with power and internet.
2. there is always someone in charge.
3. the servers don't have to be housed somewhere in the office.
