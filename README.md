# Schnuppertagbericht

We got to know Github and created a new file and uploaded it locally. i also made my first commit.

I have configured a website on the Rasperrypi02. I have given the website the name Tschoupi. Then I tested whether it works successfully.

We went to the Dc and now I know why it's worth it: 
1. all servers are redundant with power and internet
2. there is always someone in charge.
3. the servers don't have to be housed somewhere in the office.  

There are many abbreviations with abbreviated meanings:

```bash
$ touch= The touch command in Linux is used to create a new empty file.
```
